1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	The five onjexts created are the 3 Dogs (Fido with 3 legs, Fido with 4 legs, and Alfie with 4 legs), the ArrayList of Dogs, and the Comparator for the Animal method. 
3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	The Comparator constructor call is in ~line 16 of the code, within the Collections.sort() call. The class definition for the Comparator is in the java class that is imported java.util.Comparator, that has the generic constuctor for the Comparator if it used, but not created into a whole new class.
